<p>Minecon hasnt had any capes since the change to the live format and Id love to be actually able to get a cape in the future Ive played the game since 2011-2012ish not long after 10 was released 100 before 11. More java capes please. The original version of Minecraft the Java Edition currently has no legitimate way of obtaining a cape. The only way to get a free Minecraft cape without using mods is to get one from Mojang itself. One such skin pack. Minecraft Java Edition Get Your Free Cape Account Migration Youtube.</p>
